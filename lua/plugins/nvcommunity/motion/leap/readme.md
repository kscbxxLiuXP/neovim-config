# leap.nvim

Leap is a general-purpose motion plugin for Neovim, building and improving
primarily on vim-sneak, with the ultimate goal of establishing a new standard
interface for moving around in the visible area in Vim-like modal editors. It
allows you to reach any target in a very fast, uniform way, and minimizes the
required focus level while executing a jump.
